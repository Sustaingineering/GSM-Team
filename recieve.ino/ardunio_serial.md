1. Installations
Install any missing libraries using `pip install *library*`
2. From the command line, in the correct directory, run `python arduino_serial.py`
3. To stop the program, you will have to unplug the microcontroller from the computer momentarily.
NOTE: The serial sometimes gets stuck. You may need to press enter occasionally.
